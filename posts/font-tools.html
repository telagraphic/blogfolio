      Zach Leat's superb overview of his web-font loading process for <a href="https://www.zachleat.com/web/css-tricks-web-fonts/">CSS-Tricks</a>
      is just a thing of beauty. He really delves into the details, providing a practical approach for front end devs and type nerds.
      Sophisticated command line font tools are featured heavily in his approach. This post will show you how to set them up on a Mac.
    </p>

    <p>
      The cascade of commands described below will set up our machine with a python library called <a href="https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools">fonttools</a>
      and <b>pyftsubset</b> which we can use to subset our webfonts, reducing file sizes for faster browser performance.
    </p>

    <b class="superbold">
      All the commands below are run in the command line shell.
    </b>

    <h3>Homebrew</h3>

    <p>
      <a href="https://brew.sh">Homebrew</a> is the "missing package manager for macOS (or Linux)",
      it's basically like npm to node or bundler/rubygems to ruby.
      We'll need this to install python, which we'll need to install fonttools.
    </p>

    <p>
      You might need <b>xcode</b> installed if you haven't already installed it.
      Run the below command and be prepared to wait.
      See this homebrew discourse thread for <a href="https://discourse.brew.sh/t/brew-now-requires-xcode-8-0/114">potential troubleshooting.</a>
    </p>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>xcode-select --install</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <p>
      Now, let's install <b>Homebrew</b>.
    </p>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>/usr/bin/ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <p>
      For a sanity check in case you missed any errors that flew by, run <b>brew doctor</b> for troubleshooting assistance.
    </p>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>brew doctor</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

  <section class="post__article">
    <h3>Python</h3>
    <p>
      Great! With <b>Homebrew</b> all set up, let's use it to install <b>Python</b>.
      We are going to need <b>v3.0</b> or greater for <b>fonttools</b> to work.
      Mac's do come pre-installed with Python, let's see which version it is
    </p>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>python --version</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <p>
      To get v3, run
    </p>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>brew install python3</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <p>
      Homebrew is super helpful, suggesting you link python
    </p>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>brew link python3</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <p>
      If you could not get python working or see an error message, it could be about <b>usr/local</b> permissions.
      <b>Mac Sierra</b> made directory permission changes that <b>Homebrew</b> will need access to.
      See this <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47255517/brew-install-python3-didnt-install-pip3">stackoverflow post to fix</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Lastly, you might run the <b>python</b> command and not see <b>v3.7</b>.
      <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Homebrew-and-Python">Homebrew has a page</a> on this issue.
      Run <b>python3</b> to use <b>v3.7</b> when running commands in python.
    </p>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>python3 run command here</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <p>
      Finally, you'll need <b>pip</b>, the python package manager.
      It should be installed when you did <b>brew install python3</b>.
      But if you have a different python version or installed it a different way,
      there are several ways to get <b>pip</b> installed,
      <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/17271319/how-do-i-install-pip-on-macos-or-os-x">one deprecated and one that is the new offical suggestion</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is the <a href="https://pip.pypa.io/en/latest/installing/#install-or-upgrade-pip">official installation</a> commands.
    </p>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>curl https://bootstrap.pypa.io/get-pip.py -o get-pip.py</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>python get-pip.py</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <p>
      Let's run the <b>python</b> shell to see if everything works.
    </p>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>python3</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <p>
      And <b>quit()</b> to exit.
    </p>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>quit()</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <h3>Font Tools</h3>
    <p>
      We are ready to install <a href="https://github.com/fonttools/fonttools">fonttools</a>.
      You can use <b>pip</b> or <b>homebrew</b>.
    </p>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>pip install fonttools</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <p>
      Or:
    </p>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>brew install fonttools</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <p>
      We will need <b>brotli</b> for <b>woff2</b> compression when running the <b>pyftsubset</b> command.
    </p>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>pip install brotli</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <p>
      We did it, now we can use the amazing <b>pyftsubset</b> command.
      I haven't found much documentation online for this tool, but the <b>--help</b> flag is super in-depth.
      There are many options for <b>pyftsubset</b> and the commands get pretty long.
      When looking at the list of options, it truly is astounding how much technical detail goes into creating web fonts.
      There is a lot going on behind the scenes!
    </p>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>pyftsubset --help</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>pyftsubset "PublicSans.ttf" --output-file="PublicSans.woff2" --flavor=woff2 --layout-features="*" --no-hinting --desubroutinize --unicodes=U+0-10FFFF</code>
      </figure>
    </section>


    <p>
      <b>--flavor=woff2</b> will create a <b>woff2</b> compressed file for our font.
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>--layout-features="*"</b> will include all <b>OpenType</b> features.
      This is a whole other avenue I haven't explored.
      The command below will list all features if you want to learn more.
    </p>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>pyftsubset "PublicSans-Medium.ttf" --layout-features="?"</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <p>
      <b>--no-hinting</b> will not include hinting features in the <b>OpenType</b> file.
      Hinting is the process of optimizing the font for <a href="https://www.typotheque.com/articles/hinting">maximum screen readability</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>--unicodes=U+0-10FFFF</b> will include our range of glyphs we need for our website.
    </p>

    <h3>Glyphhanger</h3>
    <p>
      <a href="https://github.com/filamentgroup/glyphhanger">Glyphhanger</a> is built on top of <b>fonttools</b>
      and has awesome web font powers built in. Font expert Zach Leat has <a href="https://www.zachleat.com/web/glyphhanger/">much to say about it here</a>.
      You can get it with <b>npm</b>
    </p>


    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>npm install -g glyphhanger</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <p>
      Some noticeable differences between <b>pyftsubset</b> and <b>glyphhanger</b> are: <b>glyphhanger</b> crawls websites, returns the unicode
      characters and outputs a woff/woff2 subsetted web font, super powerful stuff!
    </p>

    <p>
      But <b>glyphhanger</b> is missing the <b>--layout-features</b> flag
      and several others that make <b>pyftsubset</b> a precise tool for cutting out font features depending on your needs.
      It really shines by returning a list of unicode characters on a site which you can use for subsetting to reduce web font sizes.
    </p>

    <section class="post__code-highlight">
      <figure>
        <code>glyphhanger http://example.com</code>
      </figure>
    </section>

    <p>
      Combine these two together and you have an efficient subsetting and compression approach for delivering web fonts.
