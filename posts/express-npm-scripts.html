      This post will show you how to use npm packages for running tasks and bundling your node app for deployment.
      This is not an exhaustive guide but enough to get you started on customizing your own configurations.
      I use this setup for deploying to heroku.

    <p>
      The problem I'm trying to solve is setting up live-reload for client and server side code when developing a node app.
      The code below will cover running a development server for coding and designing on your workstation.
      This does not cover the deployment step as that is a bit more complicated. I'll leave that up to you to figure out.
    </p>

    <p>
      Below is the structure for the app. The <b>/server</b> will contain all the backend javascript files and
      <b>/public</b> will have the same files for the static site that I just covered above.
    </p>

      <b>start</b> uses the <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/pm2">pm2</a> process manager for running the app on a production server.
      This ensures your app won't crash if something goes wrong!
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>server:restart</b> uses <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon">nodemon</a> which restarts the node application when there
      is a file change. Typically, you watch your express server file.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>public:scss</b> compiles and outputs the SASS to a <b>styles.css</b> for our client app.
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>public:watch</b> watches the <b>public/scss</b> directory for any SASS changes and re-compiles our main <b>styles.scss</b>
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>public:reload</b> uses the <b>--proxy</b> option wraps our <b>localhost:3000</b> so that we can run our server side API
      and static public files. This is the key setup that makes back-end and front-end much easier for us!
    </p>

    <p>
      <b>server</b> runs all the commands together.
