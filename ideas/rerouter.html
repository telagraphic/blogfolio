    <h3>The Idea</h3>
    <p class="idea__article--italics">
      Upgrade your router with an easy app-like interface for controlling your security/privacy tools and balance your internet
      use with features that track and limit your screen time. There are too many security tools for each device, too many sites that
      trap our attention, <b>Re-Router</b> will cover 90% of your needs and put you back in charge.

    <h3>Concepts</h3>

    <p>
      Security and privacy are obvious problems in today's connected but so has our mental and physical health with
      too much screen time, social media addiction and non-stup 24/7/365 stimulation at the touch of our fingers.
      Our brains aren't wired to handle the information overload, neither can it handle all the steps required to protect
      our identity and data on our devices.
    </p>

    <p>
      Don't hassle with setting up security tools on your devices, upgrade the one you already use - the router!
      With open source technology (ad blocker, dns, and VPN) you can cover most of you security needs. Track and
      limit your internet use with easy site blocking playlists, password manager, internet off/on scheduler with a nice
      app like interface.
    </p>

    <p>
      That thing that sits in the corner of your closet or hallway is actually the wide open front door to the Internet.
      Almost all routers lack anything that is easy or nice to look at it, you get in and get out when you have internet problems.
      <b>Re-Router</b> provides an app-like experience with a simple user interface that offers features that go beyond boring network
      details.
    </p>

    <p>
      ReRouter simplifies all the layers of web security and makes it easey to setup and control with the best open source software.
      Built with privacy and security, Re-Router embraces another principal â€” digital minimalism: the idea
      that we should use the internet in more thoughful and useful way than just endless surfing and clicking.
      The Internet of today is so very different than the internet of 10 years ago. Social media, Youtube, Netflix and
      24/7/365 stimulating content at the touch of finger has changed our minds and way of life.
    </p>

    <p>
      Re-Router gives control back to the conscious tech user and provides a set of tools and features to adjust your internet habits.
