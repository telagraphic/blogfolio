        "You already paid for the server space, how about the access keys?"

    <h3>Concepts</h3>
    <p>
      The idea is to get support for a <a href="https://petitions.whitehouse.gov/">White House Petition</a> that would
      open up an API to the NSA database servers that collect our data and share it with any citizen with a social security number.
      By showcasing NSA internet and device exploits as 'cool features' within the app, we could provide valuable and helpful
      services to users.
    </p>
    <p>
      The website would be modeled like an <a href="https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-13/">apple product page</a> highlighting
      the features and how you could use them. At the bottom of the page is the form/link to the petition to help get our app
      allowed to work with government servers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The app business model would be some sort of non-profit/public-private partnership with the government to share it's data and
      tech tools with it's taxpaying citizens.
