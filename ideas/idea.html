    <h3>Pitch</h3>
    <p class="idea__article--bold">
      FIRE Community + Prepaid Card + Anti Credit Card = Budget Card
    </p>
    <p class="idea__article--italics">
      Replace your cards' credit limit with a budget limit that turns the card off once your weekly budget is met.
      Faced with the very real 'threat' of a non-working credit card, you are forced to change your spending habits
      while still getting credit for your purchases.
    </p>
    <p>
      Problem Statement + Unique Value Proposition = Pitch
    </p>
    <p>
      The Benefit is not what you are selling, it what your selling means to the people you are selling to.
      People buy this because...
    </p>
    <p>
      The Differentiator is what is different between you and your competitors.
    </p>
    <p>
      We solve [problem] by providing [advantage], to help [target] accomplish [target’s goal].
      We make money by charging [customers] to get [benefit].

    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
      Flexbox's spacing algorithm isn't intuitive when you are first learning,
      but several CSS experts have written <a href="#">great articles</a> explaining the math
      behind how growing and shrinking work.
    </p>

    <p>
      It inspired me to build a tool I call the Flexulator for seeing
      how this formula works on flex items.
      <a href="#">Flexulator</a> is a tool in progress, but I have completed most of the javascript code that displays
      the underlying flex math.
    </p>

    <p>
      I have plans to fix up the UI, fix performance problems like grouping read/writes to prevent layout thrashing,
      and refactor the 400 line javascript file.

      In short, The Uncertainty Machine is a web-based tool to measure
      uncertainty for many different applications , some being for the age of a
      meteorite and for electrical resistance measurements. I’m definitely no
      scientist and really have no idea how to use this tool. I really wanted to
      make it look better and enhance the overall user experience. This wan’t a
      simple charity design case, I wanted to learn some skills like mobile first
      design, <a href="#">UX/UI concepts and applications</a>, use grid and flexbox, and learn
      more about forms.
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is the original version that I based my redesign on. I spent a couple
      of days auditing the UX/UI and made a plan of action that cut down the
      number of ‘steps’ from 7 to grouping them into 3 main actions, fixed up
      the form UI and added field validations and made it responsive for mobile
      with CSS Grid. The NIST scientists implemented my UX changes on the
      new version 1.4 release! Some resources I found exceptionally helpful are
      <a href="#">UXMovement</a> for insightful UX best practices, <a href="#">WTFForms</a> for a modern
      approach to styling form inputs, and <a href="#">CSS Tricks Grid Guide</a>.
