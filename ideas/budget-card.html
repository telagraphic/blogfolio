      Anti Credit Card for Overspenders and Wannabe Savers
    </p>

  <section class="idea__article">
    <h3>The Idea</h3>
    <p class="idea__article--italics">
      Replace your cards' monthly credit limit with a budget limit that turns the card off once your weekly budget is met.
      Faced with the very real 'threat' of a non-working credit card, you are forced to change your spending habits
      while still getting credit for your in-budget purchases.

    <h3>Concepts</h3>

    <p>
      Most credit cards promise you credit increases the more you spend and the longer you use it.
      But what if you are a chronic overspender, don't stick to a budget and have no savings?
      Knowing that your card will not work when you have exceeded your budget will make you stop and think about your spending habits.
      For some of us, it's just what we need for a financial reality check.
    </p>

    <p>
      We're not completely anti-credit card, you need them for big expenses, important purchases and emergencies.
      But most of your daily spending might just need to be cut back a bit to save more money for those big expenses or
      cut down on leisurely costs. It's not so much about money but habits that are hard to break.
      A credit card with a budget limit that puts the brakes on those habits can help.
    </p>

    <p>
      Paired with a FIRE approach to living and saving money, a budget limit can help on your path.
      Advice, articles and the endless tips and tricks of saving money sourced from the FIRE community can make
      your financial turnaround smoother and less painful.

    <h3>
      How It Works
    </h3>

    <h4>Financial Analysis</h4>
    <p>
      Once you download the app and create an account, connect your other card accounts, import transactions,
      analyse and categorize your spending. The budget card concept tracks all your card accounts
      for a wholistic view of your finances to make sure you catch overspending.
    </p>

    <h4>Set Budget Limit</h4>
    <p>
      Use a budget model like 50/30/20, Envelope System, or others to create a realistic weekly and monthly budget.
      Set your budget limit and turn this on for the card. Track your spending with our app to see when you
      are close to breaking your budget. If you exceed the limit, the card will not process transactions and will stop working.
      You will have to wait till next week to start again. You'll need another credit card when you first start out or have
      strong over-spending compulsions.
    </p>

    <h4>Burn and Learn</h4>
    <p>
      As you use this approach each week, you'll become aware of your bad habits or make adjustments to your budget.
      Tracking your other card accounts for those overspending transactions will help you see your patterns and or it
      will just make you feel hopeless and depressed. Utimately, you'll realize the budget card is just a tool that
      you don't need because you have gained control over your spending or you just hate how tough it makes life.
