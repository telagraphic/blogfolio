    <h3>Concept</h3>
    <p>
      One day I was walking to work and a car was sitting at the light blasting loud rap music with
      explicit lyrics, everyone could hear it. Then a GPS voice came on as the music was hushed by
      a step â€” "take a left on van damm avenue in 100 feet".
      Hence the idea was born to ruin songs with GSP voice directions.
