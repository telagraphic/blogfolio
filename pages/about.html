      <p>
        I worked in the Pre-Press department doing typesetting, file preparation and imposing print ready files for traditional, digital and large format printing.
        I also managed two web-to-print platforms covering most aspects of E-Commerce and CMS management along with
        creating custom online templates (digital typsetting like Moo) for all kinds of stationery items.
        I provided customer support to clients and tech support for internal employees.

          <p>
            Led the transition to a new test case manager system
            that reduced test time by 30% for a financial statements project.
            This increased transparency to Business Analysts and increased bug
            resolution by 33% in functional testing.

            Created an on-boarding website that reduced pair training

            be available’) by at least a third, reduced blockers by 50% and
            reduced knowledge siloing across 5 teams.
