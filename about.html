      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>
        I like to cook and make time to relax and disconnect from technology by writing and reading.
      </p>

      <p>
        Kettlebells, meditation, and taking walks are my go to activities.
        Currently reading "Oxygen Advantage" and watching "Better Call Saul".

      <p>
        I spend my time typsetting digital files for traditional print methods,
        doing some prepress work utilizing computer to plate technology and
        handling online orders and websites for web to print platforms
        that are customer facing at <a href="https://gsbdigital.com/">GSB Digital</a>.

            Testing Transition
          </h4>
          <p>
            Led the transition to a new test case manager system
            that reduced test time by 30% for a financial statements project.
            This increased transparency to Business Analysts and increased bug
            resolution by 33% in functional testing.
          </p>

          <h4>
            Implemented Onboarding Process
          </h4>
          <p>
            Created an on-boarding website that reduced pair training
            time by 50% and streamlined new hire knowledge transfer from
            2 months to 3 weeks.

            Built Knowledge Transfer Wiki

          <p>
            Built a wiki for insurance application and IT process documentation.
            This reduced testing idle time (‘time spent waiting for the lead to
            be available’) by at least a third, reduced blockers by 50% and
            reduced knowledge siloing across 5 teams.
