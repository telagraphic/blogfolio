      <h4>About Me</h4>
      <p>
        I’ve been trying out salsa recipes, cooking with water circulators,
        and experimenting with homemade cold brew.
        I try to make time to relax and disconnect from technology each day,
        printing out articles to read and write/sketch out ideas.
        Kettlebells, meditation, and taking walks are my go-to activities.
        Currently reading "The Circadian Code" and watching "Better Call Saul".

            Led the transition to a new test case manager system
            that reduced test time by 30% for a financial statements project.
            This increased transparency to Business Analysts and increased bug
            resolution by 33% in functional testing.

            Created an on-boarding website that reduced pair training

            Built a wiki for insurance application and IT process documentation.
            This reduced testing idle time (‘time spent waiting for the lead to
            be available’) by at least a third, reduced blockers by 50% and
            reduced knowledge siloing across 5 teams.
