Both standards have changed front end development for the better and modernized the tools front end devs so badly needed.</p><p> While learning flexbox, I got inspired to build <a href="https://www.flexulator.com/">Flexulator</a> a handy tool that visually illustrates how the spacing algorithm works. I decided to update the website with an improved look and refactor the spaghetti code.</p><p> In this post I'll cover some javascript refactoring, build tooling process, some UI/UX improvements and how to stay motivated while working on a side-project.</p> </section><section class="post__article"><h3>Inspiration</h3><p> Flexbox's spacing algorithm isn't intuitive when you are first learning, but several <a href="https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2018/08/flexbox-display-flex-container/">CSS experts have</a> written great articles <a href="https://chriswrightdesign.com/experiments/flexbox-adventures/">explaining the math behind</a> how it works.</p><p> Firefox Dev Tools inspired the look and feel, I cold copied styles and colors to give the site the look and feel of aweb tool. It only makes sense, the <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/">Firefox Developer Edition</a> really best Chrome's dev tools when it comes to <b>Grid</b> and <b>Flexbox</b>. Check out how they designed the <a href="https://hacks.mozilla.org/2019/01/designing-the-flexbox-inspector/">Flexbox inspector</a>.</p> </section><section class="post__article"><h3>Improvements</h3><p> The first version was a <a href="https://github.com/telagraphic/flexulator/blob/original-master/js/scripts.js">500 line spaghetti code mess of code</a> that worked, but it needed improvements. The UI was good, I got a lot of compliments.</p> </section><section class="post__list"><ul><li> Calling 10+ functions that loop over the same elements and update their text fields.

Time contraints force you to be more intentional and specific on with your work.</p><p> I use <b>Github Issues, Milestones and Kanban Board</b> to break down features into smaller tasks which are easily tracked. I use these tools like a Trello board, referencing articles and stackoverflow posts for each issue/card as well keeping checklists of all the steps required to complete the task. If you keep track of each work session and document it, you'll see how much work goes into a "simple" component of a feature. This is crucial for learning and planning your next side-project, if that's your thing.</p><p> Having worked on agile teams as a test analyst, we were required to track our progress on our current iteration cards. It built a habit of keeping a history, very helpful for many reasons like proving that you actually do work at your job. Unlike working on an agile team, side projects are full of unknowns as you start to build it. You realize things will require more time as you need to learn about a technology, research the numerous possible approaches and try out several failed attempts.</p><figure class="post__figure-video"> <video autoplay loop muted playsinline> <source src="/assets/flexulator/github-issues.webm" type="video/webm"> <source src="/assets/flexulator/github-issues.mp4" type="video/mp4"> </video> <figcaption><h5> Github Issues</h5> </figcaption> </figure><h3>Quantifying Work</h3><p> <b>Milestones</b> are great for breaking down your project into bigger chunks and then further decomposed into issues. Quantifying your work will wrap your head around the problem. Maybe you want to learn a new technology paired with skills you have picked up. Planning this out will help you stay on course when you get lost in the weeds and frustrated. Maintaining that big picture can maintain motivation and provide clarity.</p><p> Most of my efforts will be refactoring the javascript and making some design changes. Here is a table of all the UI elements that will require new code.</p> </section><section class="post__table"><table><thead><tr><th>UI</th><th>Total</th><th>Desc</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Events</td><td>3</td><td>resize, add, remove</td></tr><tr><td>Shrink Fields</td><td>14</td><td>text fields</td></tr><tr><td>Grow Fields</td><td>10</td><td>text fields</td></tr><tr><td>Buttons</td><td>4</td><td>update flex item values</td></tr><tr><td>Tabs</td><td>3</td><td></td></tr></tbody></table> </section><section class="post__article"><p> That's a grand total of 34 UI elements to code and design.</p> </section><section class="post__article"><h3>Javascript Refactor</h3><p> The first version was a 500 line spaghetti code mess of code that worked, but it needed improvements. When reviewing the code, it dawned on me that the shrink calculation in the third step was wrong. There are enough steps in the calculation to get things crossed up and some javascript objects could help keep my code better organized. After some psuedo code on paper, I determined a simple logic flow of <b>1)</b> reading values, <b>2)</b> doing calculations and then <b>3)</b> writing them to the DOM upon a resize or flex-item addition or removal. This provided a simple model of thinking about how to structure my code.</p><h3>Structure</h3><p> Each flex item has it's own flex state reflected in the four sections below.</p> </section><figure class="post__figure"> <img src="/assets/flexulator/flex-item-outline.png" alt="Flex Item Outline"> <figcaption><h5> Flex Item Component</h5> </figcaption> </figure><section class="post__article"><p> Each flex item object would have to keep track of each of these attributes on the UI. I set about creating a <b>selectors</b> object that references each child element, an <b>elements</b> object that stored those elements for reading and writing, and finally a <b>flexulations</b> object to be used for reading/writing the flex values that are re-calculated on a browser resize or flex-item form change. The UI will be modified with a function that reads the new <b>flexulations</b> and updates the DOM <b>elements</b>. You'll notice there is a <b>container</b> property that will keep track of the flex-parent item values. It will be needed in the formula for determining how much space is available.</p><p> When a user makes changes on the <b>form</b>, that items' flex values are updated inline on the object which is stored in the <b>styles</b> property. The rest of the flex-item functions use these properties for reading, calculating and updating each item. Each value on the UI get's it own function.</p> </section><section class="post__code-snippet"> <pre>
