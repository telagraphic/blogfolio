I’m definitely no scientist and really have no idea how to use this tool. I really wanted to make it look better and enhance the overall user experience. This wan’t a simple charity design case, I wanted to learn some skills like mobile first design, <a href="#">UX/UI concepts and applications</a>, use grid and flexbox, and learn more about forms.</p><p> Here is the original version that I based my redesign on. I spent a couple of days auditing the UX/UI and made a plan of action that cut down the number of ‘steps’ from 7 to grouping them into 3 main actions, fixed up the form UI and added field validations and made it responsive for mobile with CSS Grid. The NIST scientists implemented my UX changes on the new version 1.4 release! Some resources I found exceptionally helpful are <a href="#">UXMovement</a> for insightful UX best practices, <a href="#">WTFForms</a> for a modern approach to styling form inputs, and <a href="#">CSS Tricks Grid Guide</a>.</p> </section><figure class="post__figure"> <img src="/assets/flexulator/flexulator-1.png" alt="Flex Box Inspector"> <figcaption><h5> Firefox Flexbox Inspector Console</h5> </figcaption> </figure><section class="post__article"><p> I first copied the website down to my computer, fixed file paths and got it running locally to review the code.
