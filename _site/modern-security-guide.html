Many UI and UX changes are pending from feedback. Borrowed navigation concept from <a href="https://www.uber.com">Uber</a>.</p><h3>Security is Hard, Teaching It is Tougher</h3><p> Half way through making the site, I realized the overall experience wasn't really working. I had the hierachy figured out, all the different tech layers mapped out but the guide was missing the human element. People have questions about security. A Q&A style guide that answered specific questions and pain points would be a better approach.</p><p> I realized that my guide was half my personal cliff notes attempting to be an in-depth security assistant filled with endless attack vectors from all types of hackers. Average people don't have the time to secure their digitial lives.</p><h3>Enter Pi-Hole</h3><p> Network level security is where you get the most bang for your buck. A couple hours and about $80 can get you a network level DNS sinkhole right on a Raspberry Pi. <a href="https://pi-hole.net/">Pi-Hole</a> is an open source network wide ad blocker that sits between your router and home network. You can also set up VPN, DNS Server and DNS over HTTPS services right on the Pi.</p> </section> </article> </main> <noscript> You need to enable JavaScript to run this app. </noscript></body></html>
