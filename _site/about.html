I try to make time to relax and disconnect from technology each day, printing out articles to read and write/sketch out ideas. Kettlebells, meditation, and taking walks are my go-to activities. Currently reading "The Circadian Code" and watching "Better Call Saul".</p> </section><section class="about__resume-section"><header><h5> GSB Digital</h5><h6> Typsetter, Prepress &</h6><h6> Online Project Coordinator / <span>2018-2019</span></h6> </header><ul><li><h4> Customer Development</h4><p> Led the transition to a new test case manager system that reduced test time by 30% for a financial statements project.
